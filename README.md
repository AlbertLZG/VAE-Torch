##Variational Auto-encoder

This is an implementation of the paper [Stochastic Gradient VB and the Variational Auto-Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114) by D. Kingma and Prof. Dr. M. Welling.

In my other repository the implementation is in Python (Theano), this version is based on Torch7.

I only fixed the binary version for now.

To run this version:

`th binaryva.lua`
